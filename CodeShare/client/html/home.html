	    This is an example of how to use IE to create an interface in a VB application.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    In this example IE is used to create a Ribbon Menu like Office 12.  The commands are captured by the application,
	    in the BeforeNavigate2 event.  The navigation is cancelled and the command is processed.
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    You can use web pages to create a whole host of interfaces and designs, allowing you move away from the limitations of VB controls.

	    (The menu was taken from a project I am working on... hopefully the completed project can be posted up soon)
